# Each of us is an explorer on the journey of "life," and throughout this voyage, we utilize our creations to uncover the world around us.

While my journey as an explorer began with studying graphic design, it has come to encompass much more than that. As I delve into the creation process, I find that I don't solely use my hands to make art. Rather, I use them to unearth and discover the techniques and means of creation, gradually revealing my true self.

As travelers on this journey called "life," we each embark on our own expeditions. Along the way, we utilize our artistic creations to explore the world around us, employing our hands and creativity as fuel for our relentless pursuit of knowledge. It is through these voyages that we encounter artifacts (historic artists), mementos (inspirations from artists), and local features (our unique creative traits). Yet, no matter where our journeys take us, our ultimate destination will always be the revelation of ourselves.

In truth, the artwork we create is not truly invented by us, but rather discovered. These creations have always existed in the intangible realms, patiently awaiting the moment when we unveil their shrouded beauty with our own hands. Thus, throughout our adventures, we not only gain valuable experiences but also uncover our genuine selves.

The most crucial aspect of this journey is the quest for self-discovery, embracing honesty with oneself, and courageously pursuing one's dreams. By acknowledging that our creations are not of our design, but rather discovered through exploration, we can fully immerse ourselves in the experience, embracing the philosophical and creative spirit that drives us forward.
